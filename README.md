# R-IPIP50
Quickly implement and score IPIP-50 with Qualtrics and R

## What is IPIP-50?
IPIP stands for International Personality Item Pool. More specifically, the personality scale we will be working with is the [50-item IPIP representation of the Goldberg (1992) markers for the Big-Five factor structure](https://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm), IPIP-50 in short. It is designed to evaluate personality on the Big 5 domains of Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Intellect/Imagination. 

## What does this repositiory contain?
The repo contains a .qsf file which can be imported to Qualtrics as a survey. The survey contains only one question: a matrix table with all 50 items of the IPIP-50, presented as it is on its website. It also contains an R markdown notebook, which will be used to perform the actual scoring and analysis.
